VIMAZI Z40 INITIAL REVIEW - NEW PACE TUNED RUNNING SHOE MODEL FOR 2023 - EDDBUD

An initial review of the new VIMAZI Z40, a brand new company and a new shoe lineup which feature pace tuned midsoles.

A shoe fired over to me by vimazi for review, but they are not paying me to make this video and wont be vetting my video before my valued viewers.

A more responsive pace shoe this one, forget overt squash, this is all about turnover and the right cushion to create an engaging ride underfoot.

Sadly only available in the US right now, but i hear there are more ways to buy the shoes coming soon. I recommend going a half size up on this model.

I comment on the upper, midsole and outsole after my initial runs.

HOKA ROCKET X 2 - BEST NEW CARBON PLATE MODEL OF 2023? - EDDBUD

An initial review of the new HOKA ROCKET X 2, a brand new version of the previous lower price carbon plate model from a couple of years back though in truth a new shoe almost entirely. 

A shoe bought after a viewer poll suggested itâ€™s one you all want to see. 
The best Hoka shoe I have reviewed thus far on the channel. Also managed to grab this one at a 25% discount from sportshoes.com

I comment on the upper, midsole and outsole after my initial runs.
