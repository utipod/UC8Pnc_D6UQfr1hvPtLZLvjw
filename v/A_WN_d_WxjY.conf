A superb daily offering which is reasonable in weight and has a great breathable upper.\n\nA shoe sent over to me for review from SAUCONY but they are not paying me to make this video nor will they vet my views before my valued viewers.\n\nI comment on the upper, midsole and outsole after my initial runs.\nLet me know your thoughts and opinions down in the comments.\n\nA good daily option that some will over look, its got some vomero 16 DNA and thats good enough for me.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Pnc_D6UQfr1hvPtLZLvjw/join\n\nHold tight people, stay strong and we WILL make it through.\n\nKeep it nice in the comments please, i do not do unpleasant, its just ..... unpleasant. See you in the digital ones and zeros......\n\nSubscriber count as of 15/4/2023\n38635\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmail me at:\neddbudshoetube@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on Strava:\nhttps://www.strava.com/athletes/30448518\n\nFollow me on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/eddbud/\n\nJoin the EDDBUD Runners United strava group at the link below.\nhttps://www.strava.com/clubs/EDDBUDRUNNERSUNITED\n\nPlease like, share, comment and subscribe.
