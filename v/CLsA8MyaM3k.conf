description = "#VIMAZI #VIMAZIZ40 #Z40 #EDDBUD #RUNNINGSHOES\n\nVIMAZI Z40 INITIAL REVIEW - NEW PACE TUNED RUNNING SHOE MODEL FOR 2023 - EDDBUD\n\nAn initial review of the new VIMAZI Z40, a brand new company and a new shoe lineup which feature pace tuned midsoles.\n\nA shoe fired over to me by vimazi for review, but they are not paying me to make this video and wont be vetting my video before my valued viewers.\n\nA more responsive pace shoe this one, forget overt squash, this is all about turnover and the right cushion to create an engaging ride underfoot.\n\nSadly only available in the US right now, but i hear there are more ways to buy the shoes coming soon. I recommend going a half size up on this model.\n\nhttps://vimazi.com/products/mens-z40\n\nI comment on the upper, midsole and outsole after my initial runs.\nLet me know your thoughts and opinions down in the comments.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Pnc_D6UQfr1hvPtLZLvjw/join\n\nHold tight people, stay strong and we WILL make it through.\n\nKeep it nice in the comments please, i do not do unpleasant, its just ..... unpleasant.
